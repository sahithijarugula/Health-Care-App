# Pocket Doctor
## Inspiration
We were inspired by one of our teammate's personal experiences. She told us about how her mother, a nurse practitioner, would come home often dissatisfied because even though she personally had the capability to provide expert health care to patients, many of her patients could not properly access her care due to their lack of resources, whether it be finances, citizenship status, proximity, etc. It is this lack of accessibility that motivated us to create a program that could make healthcare accessible anywhere, anytime.

Many people struggle to find the transportation, financial means, and time to get to the nearest healthcare facility where they can receive proper medical care. Unfortunately, our teammate's mom's position does not enable her to spend adequate time resolving these issues. Sometimes it's too late for her to provide preventative care or allow for the most effective treatments.
## What It Does
The program takes in user details and directs them to one of our three services based on what they answer on the home page. If the user requests urgent care from their location, our locator service will determine the best local medical care option that will be the most convenient for your current status. If the user requests to explore their options for long-term care, we take in the user's personal information and determine the best healthcare insurance firm that matches their specific needs. If the user is looking for quick advice on their ailments, we provide a chatbot that suggests affordable remedies for the user.
