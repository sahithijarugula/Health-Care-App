# Pocket Doctor
## Inspiration
We were inspired by one of our teammate's personal experiences. She told us about how her mother, a nurse practitioner, would come home often dissatisfied because even though she personally had the capability to provide expert health care to patients, many of her patients could not properly access her care due to their lack of resources, whether it be finances, citizenship status, proximity, etc. It is this lack of accessibility that motivated us to create a program that could make healthcare accessible anywhere, anytime.

Many people struggle to find the transportation, financial means, and time to get to the nearest healthcare facility where they can receive proper medical care. Unfortunately, our teammate's mom's position does not enable her to spend adequate time resolving these issues. Sometimes it's too late for her to provide preventative care or allow for the most effective treatments.
